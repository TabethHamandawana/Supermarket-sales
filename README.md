# Supermarket-sales
The dataset is one of the historical sales of supermarket company which has recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months data. I came across this dataset online and admired how rich the data is as I have been trying to get my hands dirty with a very rich dataset to practice my skills of data cleaning, analysis and visualization.
